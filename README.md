# Arduino-Nano-MPU-6050-Flight-Controller-Code

This code is a work in progress that will control my quadcopter. 

My goals are to successfully, read IMU Data from the MPU-6050 to calculate craft orientation, take in commands from a radio controller, and implement a PID Controller for quadcopter dynamics and self-leveling.
